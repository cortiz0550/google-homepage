# google-homepage

This is a simple project to recreate the Google homepage. The links do not go anywhere and the search bar does not search for anything, but it was very helpful in understanding how to manipulate CSS when styling. 


## What I learned
The HTML was very straightforward as there isn't a ton on the page, but the CSS was much more interesting. I found that there were many different ways to acheive the same goals. Something I enjoyed using was pseudo-classes. It made formatting the sign-in button as well as the first li in the lists. I also have realized that putting the CSS in an organized manner will help me later on. I didn't do a great job this time, but will go back and fix it after this.

## What else I can learn
How to get the semi circles as well as the magnifying glass in the search bar. Also, I would like to make this scaleable so it will work on different devices. These are things I will go back and fix in the future, but for now I am happy that I was able to make this look pretty close to the original page!
